Our SessionKeyService and EmailService now use the factory and singleton design patterns, respectively, to get instances.

Anywhere we create a SessionKeyService should be changed to use SessionKeyFactory like so:
    SessionKeyFactory factory = new RSA256SessionKeyFactory();
    SessionKeyService service = factory.createSessionKeyService();

    This service is primarily used in the UserController, so how the service is created should be changed there, 
    as well as anywhere else it may be used (I don't think it is anywhere else)

Anywhere we create an EmailService should be changed to use EmailService.getInstance()
    For example, in most places it probably looks like this:
    @Autowired
    EmailService emailService;

    Should be changed to:
    EmailService emailService = EmailService.getInstance();

    This one is used through multiple places (mostly in the Controllers)

You don't have to change how the services are used at all, just how they are instantiated.

Please commit your changes to the main branch directly once you are done.
